# Lab 2-1 Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer

This lab aims to familiarize you with Cisco Packet Tracer and the way that networks are structured.

### Constructing Network Architecture
This activity focused on deploying switches and end devices in Packet Tracer. When connecting switches and PCs, you should use copper straight-through wire. When connecting switches together, you should use copper pass-through wire.

The completed network construction looks like this:

### Testing Connectivity
To register machines on the network, enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in two different machines, while also giving them different IP addresses that follow this format: 192.168.3.x.

You can do this by clicking on any PC and going to the config tab, and then clicking Fast Ethernet 0

Now, test the connection of these machines by going to the command prompt of any of the registered PCs (PC0>Desktop>Command Prompt)  and ping any IP address of another registered end device.

The ping command should yield a similar response in command prompt.
