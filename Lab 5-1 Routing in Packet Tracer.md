# Lab 5-1 Routing in Packet Tracer

This lab aims to demonstrate how to create a routing architecture from scratch.


### Notes:


Use the Router-PT-Empty. You will need to add three PT-ROUTER-NM-1CFE Modules to the router. To do so, do the following

Click on the router and then the physical tab. Use the slider to go all the way to the right and click the power button to turn off the router. The green light should go off. 
Under modules select the PT-ROUTER-NM-1CFE Module and drag it to the empty slot furthest to the right. Repeat with two more modules placing them in the right most empty slots. 
Turn the router back on.
This will provide you with three fast ethernet interfaces: 0/0, 1/0 and 2/0.

If your configuration does not allow for more copper cables to connect to any device, add another port to the router or switch depending on the side of the network.

If your ping does not go through, verify that the default gateways have been set up properly.

### Part 2


Add a sniffer from the End Devices Tab. Remember to use a crossover cable instead of copper straight through between the switch and sniffer.

When connected to a hub, more traffic was displayed on the network. This is because a hub basically broadcasts all information that passes through it.
