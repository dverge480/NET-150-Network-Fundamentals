# Lab 9-1 Stating Routing #1

This lab aims to demonstrate what happens to a network and routing when connecting multiple or new users.

### Notes:

#### The following information is related to PC0:
IP Address: 192.168.30.3
Default Gateway: 192.168.30.1
Can PC1 be pinged?: Yes
Can PCs 2-5 be pinged?: No

#### Why do pings to other networks fail? 
The network cannot travel farther than its own because further routing is not set up.

### Create Static Routes:

On R1, go into "config" mode
Reminder: Go to CLI, type "enable" and then "config terminal"
Then enter:

R1(config)#ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.2 

R1(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2

This provides routes to Network 3 and Network 1 respectively
On R2, go into "config" mode and enter

R2(config)#ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 

R2(config)#ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 

R2(config)#ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.20.1 

On R3, based on what you have configured for R1 and R2, what do you think the configuration should be for R3?

R3(config)#ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1

R3(config)#ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1

R3(config)#ip route 10.10.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.1

Now the network should be completely functional

#### What does the show ip route command do?

It basically shows all routes, how they are connected, and the connection information. This is useful for troubleshooting a network.

#### Imagine a larger network with 25 different network segments (subnets). What would the challenge be with using "static routes"? 

Using static routing, a larger network would be tremendously exhaustive to set up for a network administrator. Networks constantly change, and static routing isnâ€™t necessarily the most fault tolerant. Also, there is minimal scalability due to the work that must be done to route the network by hand.
